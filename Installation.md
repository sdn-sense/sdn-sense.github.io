* **Certificates**: Frontend requires cert, key certificates for its services. (Let's encrypt/Incommon)
* **Networking**: Frontend requires some ports open (Can be limited to a specific list of nodes, the list below): 
  * **sense-o.es.net** - Production Orchestrator. (Port 8080, 8443)
  * **sense-o-dev.es.net** - Development Orchestrator. (Port 8080, 8443)
