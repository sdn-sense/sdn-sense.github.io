# Allow Switch control for SENSE

Each switch which we want to allow SENSE to control, must be added to Sites configuration [here](https://github.com/sdn-sense/rm-configs). Few important notes:
1. Define all switch names under Site -> switch. (Name must match same name defined inside the ansible configuration)
2. If LLDP is enabled on switches - you do not need to make individual links (isAlias) between them. isAlias in most cases mainly needed for pointer to Network Resource manager STP.
   **NOTE: isAlias is needed for PortChannels and LAGs.**
3. vsw - Virtual Switching - to allow vlan creation (Most of the times it is the same as switch name);
4. rst - Routing Service - to allow configure BGP (private_asn number is mandatory to define if rst is defined). **NOTE: There can be only 1 rst defined per site**.
5. if allports flag set to True - it will include allPorts, except the ones listed inside the ports_ignore list.
6. if allports flag set to False - it will only include ports listed inside ports list.
7. Each port can override few parameters via configuration:
```
"Ethernet 1/1/30":
  vlan_range: [3985-3989,3610,3611,3612]
  desttype: switch
  isAlias: "urn:ogf:network:ultralight.org:2013:dellos9_s0:hundredGigE_1-13"
  wanlink: True
```
Many examples are available [here](https://github.com/sdn-sense/rm-configs)

# Configuration layout directory

Ansible inventory, configuration and template file examples are available [here](https://github.com/sdn-sense/ansible-templates)

Few notes:
1. If you installed Site-RM using siterm-startup git repo - you need to prepare `fe/conf/etc/ansible-conf.yaml`. Based on your device(s) - look for examples below.
2. Ansible can be configured to use SSH-Password and SSH-PrivKey authentication. Documentation below explains both methods.
3. **Switch defined inside the Ansible inventory file will not be represented in topology - unless it is explicitly mentioned inside the configuration for Site [here](https://github.com/sdn-sense/rm-configs)**
4. **IMPORTANT** If your network device accepts only SSH via IPv6 (and Site-RM install uses docker) - docker is known to have issues with IPv6. Please use "-n host" for frontend container startup.
5. **IMPORTANT** Ports in SENSE control on the network device, must be in trunk mode and not use access vlan. Use native vlan for traffic without vlan tag.
6. **IMPORTANT** Cisco NX OS9 and Arista EOS devices require to have empty list of allowed vlans (or any other vlans not controlled by SENSE). Please make sure SENSE controlled ports have `switchport trunk allowed vlan <none|or any other non sense controlled vlans>` parameter.
7. **IMPORTANT** If you use Dell OS9 and `rate_limit: True` - Dell OS 9 allows maximum 3 rate limits per port. If you have more than 3 rate limits per port - you will get an error. Please make sure to remove rate limits which are not needed. SENSE does not limit of how many rate limits can be set on the port.
# General ansible configuration template file
```
inventory:
  dellos9_s0: # This name must match same name inside Site configuration [here](https://github.com/sdn-sense/rm-configs)
    network_os: <NETWORK_OS_BASED_ON_MODEL_SEE_BELOW>
    host: 192.168.1.1 # Change this to IP of the device
    # One of two (pass or sshkey) must be defined. Defining both or none with result in failure.
    user: <Change to user which will be used to access device>
    pass: <Change To pass if using password. Remove if using sshkey>
    sshkey: <Change to ssh key path, if using sshkey. See Section 'How to use SSH Keys' on path location. Remove if using pass>
    become: <true|false|0|1> # Change it to true or false if it is required to use become feature on your network device.
    ssh_common_args: <Change to ssh common args if needed. For example -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q  username@jump.host.net -i <sshkey>" Will allow to use jump host>

# RAW plugin configuration

In case you use RAW (fake virtual switch) plugin - you do not need to modify `fe/conf/etc/ansible-conf.yaml` file. Make an inventory variable empty dictionary. Like this:
```angular2html
inventory: {}
```

# Dell OS 9 plugin configuration

1. If you device is Dell OS 9, for network_os make sure to set `sense.dellos9.dellos9`

# Dell OS 10 plugin configuration

1. If you device is Dell OS 10, for network_os make sure to set `sense.dellos10.dellos10`

# Azure SONiC plugin configuration

1. If you device is Azure SONiC, for network_os make sure to set `sense.sonic.sonic`

# Arista EOS plugin configuration

1. If you device is Arista EOS, for network_os make sure to set `sense.aristaeos.aristaeos`

# Juniper Junos plugin configuration

**THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED YET**

1. If you device is Juniper Junos , for network_os make sure to set `sense.junos.junos`

# FreeRTR plugin configuration

1. If you device is FreeRTR, for network_os make sure to set `sense.freertr.freertr`

# Cisco Nexus 9 plugin configuration

1. If you device is Cisco Nexus 9, for network_os make sure to set `sense.cisconx9.cisconx9`

# RAW Switch plugin configuration

**NOTE: This plugin is not very useful for L3/BGP Control. Only Sites instructed by SENSE Team should use this.**

This is dummy switch only for modelling. It has no real hardware to control. Configuration is only defined in https://github.com/sdn-sense/rm-configs repo and it does not require `fe/conf/etc/ansible-conf.yaml` file modification.

# How to use SSH Keys
To configure Site-RM to use ssh keys to access device, you need to put all ssh keys in this directory `fe/conf/opt/siterm/config/ssh-keys/`. (if you use siterm-startup scripts).
For example, if you put a key with name `fe/conf/opt/siterm/config/ssh-keys/id-rsa-sense`, then in siterm to use that key, modify `fe/conf/etc/ansible-conf.yaml` and set `sshkey` parameter to: `/opt/siterm/config/ssh-keys/id-rsa-sense`.
Be aware that key is put in path: `fe/conf/opt/siterm/config/ssh-keys/id-rsa-sense`, but for SiteRM config you use `/opt/...`. Docker will mount this directory `fe/conf/opt/` under `/opt` inside container.

# How to enable SNMP
Site-RM uses easysnmp library to query devices and their usage. Site-RM support those parameters under `session_vars```. All parameters can be found [here](https://easysnmp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/session_api.html). Here are few examples below:

1. SNMPv1:
```
    snmp_params:
      session_vars:
        community: public
        hostname: 123.123.123.123
        version: 1
```

2. SNMPv2c:
```
    snmp_params:
      session_vars:
        community: public
        hostname: 123.123.123.123
        version: 2
```

3. SNMPv3: To be defined
